### The entries withing this repo will be python code to maintain the kappa coefficient value from a set of data. 

The first entry to this repo was a peice of code created by myself for a final year BSc Environmental Science students dissertation, This student has followed onto their masters degree.
This has prompted me to publish the basic version I have created and to over time develop a more efficient and user friendly Kappa coefficient calculator.
